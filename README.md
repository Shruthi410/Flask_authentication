Flask Authentication using hashing and salting

The most important component of a website is having users. But in order to have users and associate data to user accounts, we need a way to register them and allow them to sign back into their accounts at a later date.
we're going to allow users to download a top-secret Flask Programming Cheat Sheet. But only when they have registered and signed up to our website.
Passwords are secured using Hashing and salting

#HASHING
Hashing is the process of converting a given key into another value. A hash function is used to generate the new value according to a mathematical algorithm. The result of a hash function is known as a hash value or simply, a hash.

#SALTING
In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage.
